# Experiment with kotlin-react wrappers
This is just an experiment that tries to put together a gradle build
that works with kotlin-react wrappers.

It creates a web page that shows classic sentence "Hello world"

To build it:
```sh
./gradlew build
```

To run it:
```sh
./gradlew run
```

To stop it:
```sh
./gradlew stop
```

Open [http://localhost:7777/](http://localhost:7777/) to view it in the browser.<br>
